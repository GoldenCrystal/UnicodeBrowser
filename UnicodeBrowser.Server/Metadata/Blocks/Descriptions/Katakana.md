The `Katakana` block contains modern-day Japanese katakana (カタカナ) characters, as well as a few characters used in japanese writing.

Because katakana are mainly used to transcript foreign languages, the katakana block contains a few extra letter characters over the [Hiragana](/blocks/Hiragana) block.
Most katakana letters will still map to their equivalent hiragana letter in the [Hiragana](/blocks/Hiragana) block by subtracting `0x60`.
