The `Mahjong Tiles` block includes characters for representing the tiles used in the game of Mahjong.

The block currently includes only one emoji as [U+1F004](/codepoints/1F004) `MAHJONG TILE RED DRAGON` (ðŸ€„).
However, recent versions of `Segoe UI Emoji` include Emoji representations for all of the tiles.
